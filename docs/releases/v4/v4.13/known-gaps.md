### Open Items

#### WN-2: Tool-span attributes unverified at the pinned revision

**Source phase**: Phase 2. **Plan reference**: T005. **Reason**: the `gen_ai.tool.*` attribute table could not be retrieved at pinned revision `5ca9052bc796ef1e497200b1d558fd87a201f335`. The containing document truncates before that section and the standalone tool-spans path returns HTTP 404 at that revision. The `execute_tool` operation name itself is confirmed.

**Owner**: `ai-agent-development` maintainer. **Status**: open. **Suggested next step**: the first consumer needing a `gen_ai.tool.*` attribute verifies it against the sibling inference/tool specification and adds it to `references/agent-span-contract.md` with its requirement level. Until then the contract marks those attributes unverified, and no requirement level was invented to fill the gap.

#### WN-3: The shipped catalog under-triggers on its own positive prompts

**Source phase**: Phase 6. **Plan reference**: T022, T023. **Reason**: the pilot's control arm is the currently shipped corpus. Across four sampled skills and eight positive prompts it selected the skill on **1/8** with the fast model and **3/8** with the strong model, while producing **zero** irrelevant selections across all 32 near-miss and trivial-edit prompts. The catalog's measured failure mode is under-triggering, not over-triggering.

**Evidence**: `development/trigger-pilot-results.md` and the raw `trigger-pilot-results.json` (96/96 calls, 0 failures, 0 evidence-missing). The regression is concentrated in `skill-description-authoring` on the strong model, 2/2 to 0/2 under the candidate wording.

**Owner**: catalog maintainer. **Status**: open. **Suggested next step**: this finding is recorded, not acted on. `AGENTS.md` prescribes pushier descriptions with explicit SKIP clauses as the remedy, and the pilot measured that remedy making selection **worse** on both models, so the prescribed fix is now evidence-contradicted. Changing the authoring guidance needs its own frozen pilot with a candidate designed against this data; nothing in this release may change a description on the strength of the finding alone.

#### WN-4: Acceptance criterion 3 was unreachable by construction

**Source phase**: Phase 6. **Plan reference**: T021. **Reason**: the frozen protocol requires "at least one strict reduction in irrelevant loading or unnecessary pauses". The control arm produced zero irrelevant loads, so no reduction was available to any candidate and the criterion could not be satisfied regardless of the candidate's quality. The criterion assumed a baseline of over-triggering that the measurement then contradicted (see WN-3).

**Owner**: catalog maintainer. **Status**: open. **Suggested next step**: a future trigger pilot states its criteria relative to a measured baseline rather than an assumed one, or measures the baseline in a calibration slice before the criteria are frozen. The criterion is recorded as a defect in the protocol, not as a property of variant B; variant B independently failed criterion 1, which is what actually decided the disposition.

### Resolved Items

#### DF-1: Phase 6 trigger pilot deferred as UNMEASURED -- RESOLVED (measured)

**Source phase**: Implementation entry (recorded at Phase 1). **Resolved at**: Phase 6, 2026-09-16.

The entry gate held implementation until a native execution path supplied five controls at once. Read-only inspection at Phase 1 found two of the five absent and recorded the deferral. That inspection had examined two repository scripts and neither the `claude` CLI's structured output nor its budget flag.

**How it was resolved**: `scripts/run_trigger_pilot.py` wraps the CLI's `stream-json` output and supplies all five controls (two model tiers via `--model`; observed selection from the `init` event and the tool-call stream; bounded subprocess time; an aggregate spend ceiling summed from `result.total_cost_usd` across calls; isolation via `--setting-sources`, `--add-dir`, `--strict-mcp-config`). The residual constraint was **cost**, not capability: the frozen 96-call matrix costs roughly USD 33 against an original USD 10 ceiling. That ceiling was raised to USD 35 with explicit maintainer authorization and recorded as amendment 1 to the frozen protocol. The scored run completed at **USD 20.6709**.

**Outcome**: the pilot ran to completion and no candidate qualified. Disposition `MEASURED_NO_CHANGE`; nothing was promoted. See `development/trigger-pilot-results.md`.

#### QG-1: Phase 6 acceptance criteria unexercised -- RESOLVED (evaluated)

**Source phase**: Implementation entry (recorded at Phase 1). **Resolved at**: Phase 6, 2026-09-16.

All four frozen criteria were evaluated per model against the measured data. Criteria 1 and 3 failed on both models; criteria 2 and 4 passed. Variant B is not promoted for either model.

Criterion 3's failure is carried forward as **WN-4**, because it was unreachable by construction rather than by any property of the candidate.

#### WN-1: Pre-existing commit-attribution findings -- RESOLVED

**Source phase**: Phase 1. **Resolved at**: Phase 6, 2026-09-16.

Phase 1 recorded `check_commit_attribution` failing with 3186 findings across 3377 scanned commits, all predating this plan. The condition has since been corrected in local history.

```
$ python scripts/check_commit_attribution.py --all-refs
Attribution: 1740 commits scanned; 0 findings; 0 errors
exit 0
```

The scanned-commit count fell from 3377 to 1740 because the earlier figure included commits reachable only through stale refs and two worktrees left on detached pre-rewrite heads, not because history was truncated. `python scripts/ci/run.py --profile fast --quiet` now reports `PASS: 15 passed, 0 failed`.
